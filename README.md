# Data Science AI and Risk Management Industry Group
This repository contains code examples pertaining to proxy discrimination and individualisation of risk premiums for the _Data Science &amp; AI Risk Management Industry Group_.

## Data
We are utilising synthetic data generated in So, B., Boucher, J-P., and Valdez, E.A., 2021. Synthetic dataset generation of driver telematics. _Risks_, 9(4), 58. The dataset is available at http://www2.math.uconn.edu/~valdez/data.html. We have included int the `data/` folder for reference.

## Aim
The aim of the investigation is to utilise a motor insurance pricing example in order to evidence instances of proxy discrimination, fairness, individualisation of premiums, and the use of explainability techniques.

This repository serves to supplement the write-up currently underway with suitable results.

## In-progress
We are currently working on the following:
- Investigating whether there is evidence to suggest proxy discrimination on the basis of gender as a protected feature.
- Applying fairness algorthims to determine whether protected classes of being unfairly treated.
- Comparing individual risk assessment against aggregate measures to determine if this remains in the policyholder's best interest.
- Applying explainability techniques to risk-govern 'black-box' models applied to this dataset.
